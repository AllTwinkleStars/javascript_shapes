The ellipse is very similar to its cousin, the [circle](/circle), but instead of just one radius, the ellipse has two, `rx` and `ry`.

</svg>
{% endhighlight %}

As with the circle, `cx` and `cy` define the x and y coordinates of the center of the ellipse.
The distance from the center to the top of the ellipse is defined by `ry` and the distance from the
center to the side of the ellipse is set by `rx`. So if you want a tall ellipse, you'll need `rx < ry`, whereas
if you want a wide one, you'll need `rx > ry`. And setting `rx = ry` will give you a perfect circle.
