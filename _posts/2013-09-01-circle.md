As far as shapes go, they don't come much more fundamental than the circle. The SVG `circle` element allows us to draw it in all its roundly goodness.

{% highlight html %}
<!-- An example of using static SVG to draw a circle -->
<svg>
	<circle cx='200' cy='200' r='150' fill="none" stroke="#333" stroke-width="2" />
</svg>
{% endhighlight %}

The element has 3 circle-related attributes:

* `cx` is the x-coordinate of the circle's center
* `cy` is the y-coordinate of the circle's center
* `r` is the circle's radius

If you don't specify a value for `cx` or `cy`, they circle's center will be located at (0,0).
That pretty much sums it all up to be honest. If you like circles, then you'll love [ellipses]({% post_url 2013-09-03-ellipse %}).
