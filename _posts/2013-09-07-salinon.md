The salinon, a shape first studied by Archimedes, is made from four semicircles. An outer and inner semicircle which are opposite each other,
and have diameters of `dOuter` and `dInner` respectively, are connected to each other by two other semicircles which are equal in size. The diameter
of each of these twin semicircles must be `(dOuter-dInner)/2`.

Like the [crescent]({% post_url 2013-09-06-crescent %}) and [arbelos]({% post_url 2013-09-06-arbelos %}), the SVG path data for a salinon is made entirely from circular arcs,
in this case, four are needed.

{% highlight html %}
<!-- Example SVG for a salinon -->
<svg>
	<path stroke-width="2" d="M50,200A150,150 0 0,1 350,200A25,25 0 0,0 300,200A100,100 0 0,1 100,200A25,25 0 0,0 50,200" fill="none" stroke="#333" />

{% endhighlight %}

The points all lie on the same horizontal line (`y=200` for the above). The first arc, `A150,150 0 0,1 350,200` goes from the far left to the far right,
and the next three successively weave back to the start point.

Note also, that for the twin arcs, the `sweep-flag` is `0`, ie the opposite of what it is for the
other two arcs because they are travelling in the opposite direction. If you need a recap of what these flags actually do, check out the description on the
[crescent page]({% post_url 2013-09-06-crescent %}).
