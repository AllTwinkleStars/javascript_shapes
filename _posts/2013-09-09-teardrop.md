title: Teardrop
name: teardrop
---

At a very basic level, the teardrop shape can be thought of as an isoceles triangle placed
on top of a semi-circle. The height of this triangle is called `triangleHeight`, and the
diameter of the semicircle, which we've set to be exactly equal to the size
of the triangle's base, is denoted `width`.

However, this produces a very rigid looking teardrop. It can be made to look much more
natural by replacing the straight lines (those that link the edges of the semicircle to the
tip of the teardrop) by cubic beziers.

Both of the cubic bezier curves need two control points. Each curve has
a control point directly above the edge of the semicircle, on opposite sides, and this can be controlled
by adjusting `yCP2`. The other control point is located in the same position for
both curves, directly underneath the tip of the tear drop, and it's vertical position is denoted
`yCP1`.

<!-- Example static SVG for a teardrop shape -->
<svg width='400px' height='400px'>
	<path d="M200,40C200,80 280,180 280,240A80,80,0 0,1,120,240C120,180 200,80 200,40" fill="none" stroke="#333" stroke-width="2" />

Breaking down the path data, we get:

* `M200,400` moves the pen to the very top of the teardrop
* `C200,80 280,180 280,240` draws a cubic bezier from the top to the the left edge of the teardrop,
with control points located at`200,80` and `280,180`.
* `A80,80,0 0,1,120,240` draws a semicircular arc (radius of 80) from the left edge to the right edge.
* `C120,180 200,80 200,40` draws a second cubic bezier back up to the top of the teardrop, with
control points that are a mirror image of those in the first curve.
