The sector, which looks extremely similar to Pac-Man, is another shape that makes use of SVG's excellent arc command.

{% highlight html %}
<svg width='400px' height='400px'>
	<path d="M200,200 L338,120 A160,160 0 1,0 338,280 Z" fill="none" stroke="#333" stroke-width="2" />
</svg>
{% endhighlight %}

The path data can be broken into the following chunks:

* `M200,200` moves the pointer to the middle of the sector
* `L338,120` draws a line from the center to the point where the arc will begin
* `A160,160 0 1,0 338,280` draws a circular arc of radius `160` all the way round to the opposite side
from where the arc originally began
* `Z` draws a straight line back to the center

We can use trigonometry to find the exact coodinates of the start and end points of the arc. If
`cx,cy` indicate the center of the sector, and `angle` is the size of the Pac-Man's mouth (in radians), then
the coordinates can be calculated with the following equations:

{% highlight js %}
arcStart = cx + (radius*Math.cos(angle/2)), cy - (radius*Math.sin(angle/2);
arcEnd = cx + (radius*Math.cos(angle/2)), cy + (radius*Math.sin(angle/2);
{% endhighlight %}

The only other caveat of which you should be aware is that we need to implement a conditional to make sure that
the `large-arc-flag` is set to `1` only if the angle is greater than 180&deg;.
