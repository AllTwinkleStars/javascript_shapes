The sector, a.k.a *Pac-Man* shape, is another shape that makes use of SVG's excellent arc command.

{% highlight html %}
<svg width='400px' height='400px'>
	<path d="M200,200 L338,120 A160,160 0 1,0 338,280 Z" fill="none" stroke="#333" stroke-width="2" />
</svg>
{% endhighlight %}

The path data can be broken into the following chunks:

* `M200,200` moves the pointer to the middle of the sector
* `L338,120` draws a line from the center to the point where the arc will begin
* `A160,160 0 1,0 338,280` draws a circular arc of radius `160` round to the opposite side from where the arc began
* `Z` draws a straight line back to the center

We can use trigonometry to find where the arc needs to start from and end. By The `x,y` coordinates
of the start point can be calculated with the following formula:

`cx + (radius*Math.cos(angle/2)), cy - (radius*Math.sin(angle/2)`

where `cx,cy` indicated the center of the sector, and `angle` is the size of the Pac-Man's mouth, in radians.
The arc ends at the point directly opposite the above:

`cx + (radius*Math.cos(angle/2)), cy + (radius*Math.sin(angle/2)`
