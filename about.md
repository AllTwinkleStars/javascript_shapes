UnitedShapes is a site that explains how to make shapes using a pinch of SVG and a sprinkling of javascript. Some of the shapes are intricate, others are simple&mdash;each has an aesthetic appeal in its own unique way.

A built-in user interface allows you to tweak a few properties here and there, and each shape is linked directly to CodePen for infinite editing possibilities.

If your interest has been sparked, please head over to the [Github repository](https://github.com/Aptary/unitedshapes) where you can find out how to submit your own geometric masterpieces.

The project was created by <a href='http://aptary.com'>Aptary</a>, a web development lab run by <a href="https://twitter.com/Aptary">Ed Ball</a>.
